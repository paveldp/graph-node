//! Support for the management of the schemas and tables we create in
//! the database for each deployment. The Postgres schemas for each
//! deployment/subgraph are tracked in the `deployment_schemas` table.
//!
//! The functions in this module are very low-level and should only be used
//! directly by the Postgres store, and nowhere else. At the same time, all
//! manipulation of entities in the database should go through this module
//! to make it easier to handle future schema changes

// We use Diesel's dynamic table support for querying the entities and history
// tables of a subgraph. Unfortunately, this support is not good enough for
// modifying data, and we fall back to generating literal SQL queries for that.
// For the `entities` table of the subgraph of subgraphs, we do map the table
// statically and use it in some cases to bridge the gap between dynamic and
// static table support, in particular in the update operation for entities.
// Diesel deeply embeds the assumption that all schema is known at compile time;
// for example, the column for a dynamic table can not implement
// `diesel::query_source::Column` since that must carry the column name as a
// constant. As a consequence, a lot of Diesel functionality is not available
// for dynamic tables.
